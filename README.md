To test a local working copy of chill (from the development branch):  
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
- Set $OMEGAHOME and compile omega.  
- Run _python -m testchill local *path-to-chill*_   
  This creates a temporary directory where it builds chill in each
  configuration and tests it.
